Synopsis :

mysvm is an attempt to create a virtual machine for mini-scheme. It is purely for experimental purposes and should not be used as the official svm.
mysvm has a mini-scheme compiler included. This compiler was not developped by the author and is just there to test mysvm. Read the compiler's Licence before continuing. The source files are not included for the compiler.

mysvm can handle multiple operations such as :
- additions (+)
